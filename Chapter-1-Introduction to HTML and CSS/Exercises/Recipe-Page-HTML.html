        <h1>Bath Spa RAK Student Cultural Food Spotlight: Filipino Food Recipes</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to what could be potentially your first proper exposure of a <strong>Filipino Cuisine</strong> recipe. It's fine if you are not particularly excited with it but still, I would like to share this one regardless. </p>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
        
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Blend lime zest, lime juice, mango nectar, half of mangoes, and a small pinch of salt in a blender until very smooth.
</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Heat gelatin and ½ cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in mango purée. Pour jelly into a 9x5" loaf pan. Carefully add remaining mangoes and stir to combine. Cover jelly tightly and chill until set, 20–30 minutes.
Do ahead: Mango jelly can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled..</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Cook sugar and 1 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then cook, undisturbed, swirling pan occasionally and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush as needed, until mixture turns deep amber, 7–9 minutes. Scrape caramel into another 9x5" loaf pan.</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Whisk egg yolks, coconut milk, condensed milk, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into loaf pan with caramel. Cover with foil. Set inside a roasting pan and place on oven rack. Carefully pour hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of loaf pan (a tea kettle makes this easy if you have one).</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong>Bake flan until just set in the center (it should still wobble a little when gently jiggled) and barely golden on top, 55–60 minutes. Let cool (still covered), then chill until cold, at least 4 hours. 
Do ahead: Flan can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Spread out corn on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle sugar and salt over, then drizzle oil over and toss to combine. Roast until crisped slightly but not yet browned and a little sticky, 12–15 minutes. Let cool.</p>
        <p><strong>7. ALMOST THERE</strong> Spread out corn on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle sugar and salt over, then drizzle oil over and toss to combine. Roast until crisped slightly but not yet browned and a little sticky, 12–15 minutes. Let cool..</p>
        <p><strong>8. REAL CLOSE</strong>Toast coconut in a small skillet over medium heat until edges start to brown and crisp, about 5 minutes (be careful not to overcook).</p>
        <p><strong>7. FINALLY</strong> Cut flan into 1"pieces and divide some among tall glasses or wide bowls. Cut out mango jelly into desired shapes and arrange on top, then spoon in ice cream, condensed milk, shaved ice, strawberries, macapuno, palm seeds, corn, sago pearls, toasted coconut, red beans, and pinipig as desired.</p>
